          <p>I'd always dreamt of traveling the world, whatever that means, but I was always too afraid to actually do it. My family was never much for traveling, and didn't have much exposure to other cultures. Though I've always been adventurous, I felt too intimidated to venture that far out on my own. I didn't even leave my hometown for college. The following details trips I took over the course of a little over a year to finally force myself out of my shell.</p>

          <h3>Studying abroad in Thailand</h3>
          <p>I'd never left the country before, but I really wanted to study abroad. The university I attended has campuses in several countries and I kept telling myself I needed to take advantage of the program. By my last year in school, I was running out of time so I finally decided to do it. Admittidly, my decision of location was largely based on finances, because I was able to go the Thai campus for cheaper than any other other international campus (and even my home campus). It ended up being the best choice I think I could have made.</p>

          <h3>Spring break in Vietnam</h3>
          <p>For spring break I went to Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam with three friends.</p>
          <p>I fell in love with the food in Vietnam. I hadn't really had Vietnamese food before visiting, but I could have lived there because of it. Of course the ph&#7903; was delicious anywhere I had it, but my favorite meal was a bahn mi sandwich from a food cart near the hostel I stayed at. I don't have a photo of this beauty, and I honestly still don't know exactly what was on it, but it was my go to at about 1:00 in the morning after a night out.</p>

          <h3>Visiting a friend in Jordan</h3>
          <p>After returning from studying abroad, I finished my final semester of college and then moved to Chicago. A few months after moving, my savings were nearly gone and I knew I'd have to get a full-time job soon. I decided to take one more trip before starting "adulthood." I went with my girlfriend at the time to visit her friend in her hometown of Amman, Jordan. We spent several weeks traveling around the country.</p>

          <h3>Exploring Israel</h3>
          <p>During our trip to Jordan, we spent a week in Israel. My ex-girlfriend has distant cousins who live there, so we were able to stay with a few of them. We spent most of our time in Jeruselum, Tel Aviv and Haifa. I had never planned to visit Israel but it was a very interesting experience that I'm glad to have had.</p>
